        <!-- Random paragraph elements -->
        <p id="para1">Luckily I am not applying for a Design role at Posthog (and probably would not have made it this far if I were), but I am still happy to share with you the poorly designed write-up after my Superday!</p>

        <h3>So how did the day go?</h3>
        <p id="para2">I had a lot of fun. I love a good challenge, and the Superday task did not disappoint. The task was well explained, and even though the explanations were vague at times, I think I managed to deliver an okay job.  </p>
     
        <p id="para3">The Demo part is probably what sits the most with me. My performance there does not go into any halls of fame, or deserve an award for the best delivered demo of all times, but I did what I could with the resources and time I had. Stress was definitely a factor there, but more importantly I think the robustness of the platform, and delivering the value in a short time span was harder than I had thought. I hope I did an okay job though, and have the chance to build up on that and improve it later. I usually give good demos, I promise :)</p>
        
        <p>How I delivered the other tasks are very representative of how I work normally, so hopefully helps you make a decision if I am a good fit for the team and how you like to work. I've included as much detail as possible. I do believe I can contribute to the team and bring in new knowledge and help shape the future of sales at Posthog.</p>
        <p id="para4">Last but not least, thank you for having me. I had a blast working on the task today. It was definitely challenging, but I expected that. Meeting the team was inspiring. I hope to have the chance to work with you, either as a colleague, and if not, maybe a future customer. Who knows! </p>
        <p id="para5">Ps. Pineapple on pizza is a no-go.</p>
